NAME
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::GenShellCompletion - Generate shell completion
    scripts when distribution is installed

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.06 of
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::GenShellCompletion (from Perl distribution
    Dist-Zilla-Plugin-GenShellCompletion), released on 2014-12-18.

SYNOPSIS
    In your dist.ini:

     [GenShellCompletion]

DESCRIPTION
    This plugin modifies "Makefile.PL" so that when a user installs your
    distribution with "make install", shcompgen is invoked to generate shell
    completion scripts for your scripts. This is convenient because
    immediately after the user installs your distribution, shell tab
    completion is already activated for your scripts.

    shcompgen recognizes several ways/hints to generate completion to your
    scripts. Please see its documentation for more details.

    Some notes:

    First, user must already install and setup shcompgen prior to installing
    your distribution. But if "shcompgen" is installed after your
    distribution is installed, she can simply run "shcompgen generate" to
    scan PATH and generate completion for all recognized programs, including
    yours.

    Second, this plugin's implementation strategy is currently as follow
    (probably hackish): insert some code in the generated "Makefile.PL"
    after "WriteMakefile()" to insert some targets in the "Makefile"
    generated by "Makefile.PL".

    Third, currently only MakeMaker is supported, Module::Build is not.

SEE ALSO
    shcompgen

    CLI scripts using the Perinci::CmdLine framework will automatically have
    shell tab completion capability. "shcompgen" detects this.

    You can also use Getopt::Long::Complete or Getopt::Long::Subcommand.
    "shcompgen" also detects this.
