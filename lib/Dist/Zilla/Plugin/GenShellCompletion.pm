=head1 NAME

Dist::Zilla::Plugin::GenShellCompletion - Generate shell completion scripts when distribution is installed

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 0.06 of Dist::Zilla::Plugin::GenShellCompletion (from Perl distribution Dist-Zilla-Plugin-GenShellCompletion), released on 2014-12-18.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

In your dist.ini:

 [GenShellCompletion]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This plugin modifies C<Makefile.PL> so that when a user installs your
distribution with C<make install>, L<shcompgen> is invoked to generate shell
completion scripts for your scripts. This is convenient because immediately
after the user installs your distribution, shell tab completion is already
activated for your scripts.

L<shcompgen> recognizes several ways/hints to generate completion to your
scripts. Please see its documentation for more details.

Some notes:

First, user must already install and setup L<shcompgen> prior to installing your
distribution. But if C<shcompgen> is installed after your distribution is
installed, she can simply run C<shcompgen generate> to scan PATH and generate
completion for all recognized programs, including yours.

Second, this plugin's implementation strategy is currently as follow (probably
hackish): insert some code in the generated C<Makefile.PL> after
C<WriteMakefile()> to insert some targets in the C<Makefile> generated by
C<Makefile.PL>.

Third, currently only MakeMaker is supported, L<Module::Build> is not.

=for Pod::Coverage setup_installer before_build

=head1 SEE ALSO

L<shcompgen>

CLI scripts using the L<Perinci::CmdLine> framework will automatically have
shell tab completion capability. C<shcompgen> detects this.

You can also use L<Getopt::Long::Complete> or L<Getopt::Long::Subcommand>.
C<shcompgen> also detects this.
